                    <p>
                        The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire 
                            youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
                            team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
                            this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey 
                            background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
